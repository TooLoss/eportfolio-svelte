The focus was on efficiency: the tool needed to process documents quickly using just a phone camera, with minimal user input. To achieve this, I automated the entire workflow, from image capture to digital conversion.",

I choose a bottum down tactics and found smaller issues to tackle in order to make it work.\n- Find corner position of the document\n- Make a transformation to the correct format\n- Treshold locally to make it efficient against light changes and shadow",
